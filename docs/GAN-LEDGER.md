# GAN ledger

Every adversarial round is recorded here, in order (Charter 2.4 step 8). This file also records spec freezes, amendments and calibration results. Discriminator replies are saved verbatim in each round's packet folder under `qa/rounds/`.

## Stage 0 — Spec freeze

Only `pki-discriminator` runs at Stage 0, and it judges the written spec (no frames). Cinematic and legibility scores start at Stage 1. Changes made between Stage 0 rounds are pre-freeze drafting, not amendments: the spec is frozen only when this stage's gate passes.

### stage0-R1

- **Candidate:** `948d0c9869c0c8e8a92b07e5ee90d1d9f314573c`
- **Spec SHA-256 (candidate):** `cf5b596203deb0978544c52460d66afae35f3be73551ee0a92ecccc51b3bf2a7`
- **Packet:** `qa/rounds/stage0-R1/`
- **Discriminator report:** `qa/rounds/stage0-R1/pki-discriminator.json`. Saved as delivered in the agent's hand-back message: the agent's background transcript file was empty, so the hand-back was the only copy.
- **Discriminator:** fresh `pki-discriminator` (opus). It read only packet files, as its `files_read` shows.
- **Beat verdicts:**
  - 30 ACCURATE
  - 3 MISLEADING: B-05.2, B-06.1, B-06.6
  - 0 WRONG
- **Findings:** 0 BLOCKER, 2 MAJOR, 6 MINOR.
- **Scores:** L-08 = 9 (advisory; it is not a Stage 0 gate criterion).
- **Hard discriminators:** `pytest` 81 passed; `ruff check` clean; `mypy --strict` clean.

**Triage (Chief of Staff).** All 8 findings are ACCEPTED; none misreads the frozen-spec candidate. No severity was changed.

| Finding | Sev | Decision | Reason / fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| PKI-S0R1-01 | MAJOR | ACCEPTED | Correct: one TLS handshake presents one server Certificate message, and RDP enrollment is driven by server-side policy, not by the connection. Fixes: the S2 attempt now closes (`E-02.2c`); S6 opens with a new connection pulse (`E-06.1a`); spec, notes and storyboard state that enrollment is server-side and policy-driven, with no pending connection during it. Beats were neither deleted nor merged. |
| PKI-S0R1-02 | MAJOR | ACCEPTED | Correct: REQ-RDP had no end of life inside Issuing CA 1, so a white capsule leaving Issuing CA 1 for the root was ambiguous. Fixes: `REQUEST_CONSUMED` events at each destination (`E-04.4a`, `E-05.2c`, `E-08.2a`); the CA request carries a cyan CA=true band and the must-read tag `LBL-REQ-CA1` ("Issuing CA 1's own CA request"); it is sealed by Issuing CA 1's own key module. |
| PKI-S0R1-03 | MINOR | ACCEPTED | The root's seal is revealed by light as an existing property, with no key-module glow and no press motion in the present. |
| PKI-S0R1-04 | MINOR | ACCEPTED | A "handshake proof (signature impression)" shape was added to C-11 (14 shapes), with IoU ≤ 0.6 against both keys. The B-06.1 wording now says no key material travels. |
| PKI-S0R1-05 | MINOR | ACCEPTED | `E-06.2c` transport changed to `none` (era recall); the shimmer plays on the card in place. |
| PKI-S0R1-06 | MINOR | ACCEPTED | B-04.1's opening sentence was reworded to "pauses at the server's outbound port, framed with the AD node". This was done before the freeze, so no amendment is needed. |
| PKI-S0R1-07 | MINOR | ACCEPTED | The model's `CERT-RDP-SELF` SAN was set to empty; the notes say no SAN is modelled or shown. |
| PKI-S0R1-08 | MINOR | ACCEPTED | The notes (B-02.3, B-03.1) now say the template definition is read from the AD enrollment policy before key generation, and that B-04.1 is the CA-selection lookup. |

**Charter deviation, recorded.** Charter 7 words B-05.1 as "Its self-signed seal closes on itself". The spec keeps the closed-ring seal but reveals it statically (PKI-S0R1-03), because a present-tense closing animation would misrepresent the offline root (Charter 3.9: do not reduce PKI accuracy).

**New hard tests** (in `tests/test_gan_findings.py`; never delete):
- `test_PKI_S0R1_01_one_certificate_per_connection_attempt` (MAJOR)
- `test_PKI_S0R1_02_requests_end_at_their_destination_and_the_ca_request_is_labelled` (MAJOR)
- `test_PKI_S0R1_03_root_performs_no_operation_in_the_present`
- `test_PKI_S0R1_04_handshake_proof_is_not_key_material`
- `test_PKI_S0R1_05_trust_store_recall_does_not_travel`
- `test_PKI_S0R1_07_self_signed_certificate_contents_match_notes`

PKI-S0R1-06 is covered by the existing discovery and route test. PKI-S0R1-08 is documentation only.

Both MAJOR tests fail on the R1 candidate model (two leaf certificates in one CH-RDP attempt; no request consumption events), so they really discriminate.

**Regressions registry:** all 8 findings were added to `qa/regressions.json`.

**Gate decision: NOT PASSED** (2 MAJOR, 3 MISLEADING beats). Proceed to R2 with fixes.
